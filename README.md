## API Documentation

After running the application, you can access the API documentation through Swagger UI.

Follow these steps:

1. Run the application.
2. Open your web browser and navigate to:

   [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html)

This will open the Swagger UI, where you can explore the available API endpoints, their request/response details, and even test the APIs directly.
